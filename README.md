# Finco.

Finco. was created by two Business and Computer Science students who realized the bottleneck in the investment banking industry. Financial analysts and stock traders spend countless hours crunching numbers and navigating between multiple reports. Finco. compresses all this information, scrapes the web, and provides accurate valuations as well as other financial documents.

Finco's automates the process of generating financial documentation and valuations for companies traded on the NASDAQ and NYSE. Provides user with a live stock price index, current balance sheet, liquidity ratios, current income statement, and a projected discounted cash flow statement.
